# rxing - cRustacean Crossing

This is a port of the ZXing (https://github.com/zxing/zxing) java barcode library to pure rust. Conversion was done by hand. Original license resides with the authors of zxing.

Porting of the testing library is incomplete.

Porting was done with the rust language in mind, though some parts may resemble java more directly than a proper clean-sheet rust implementation.
